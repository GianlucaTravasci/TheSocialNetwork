# TheSocialNetwork
A social network build for test my js knowledge.
As i said this is just a test, there are many changes that could be done, for example: convert the app into an API, error handleling in a separate file, consistency in the function declaration and Promise / async-await usage, add comments for organization...
Those tasks are TODOs for the future.
